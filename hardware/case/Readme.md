# Models:
This folder includes a set of 3D models that were used for a case in the original design. The case included a main body with an integrated ESP dock and sensor holes, a sliding lid, an additional shroud for the STM to allow easy removal, inserts to allow easier positioning of the sensors, and a stand to elevate the case and allow cables underneath.

## Main Box:
The main box includes a housing for an ESP32-WROVER unit, space for an STM32 in the provided shroud, a passive infrared sensor, and a laser distance sensor. Holes are also provided for the charging cables for both units, at the bottom. This can either be a free-standing unit using the included stand, or you can drill some holes in the backplate and hang it on the wall. 

## Inserts:
The inserts were added to make it easier to position the sensors. Think of them as guides that you can stick to the box, covering the bigger holes. You can also either incorporate these into the case in external software or just make your own holes, if you want.

## Printing Instructions:
All parts were printed at 100% size with PLA filament. You may want to dial in your printer before printing, as the cover can be a bit finnicky to get sliding.

## Additional Securing:
We used bluetack to stick everything together, including keeping the sensors in place and mounting the inserts. I would suggest something more robust like glue for use in a proper environment, or possibly something like electrical tape - however, bluetack served as a low-cost, safe, and non-damaging way to temporarily mount our components. You can also add some velcro strips to the STM shroud to make it secure, but removable.

## Modifications:
After printing, I personally had to expand the STM power port hole as the cable we were using was much bigger than usual. If you have a normal small cable, you may be fine, but otherwise, either take like a dremel to it or modify the STL in software - TinkerCad is a good option.
